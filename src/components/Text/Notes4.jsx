      <p>
        HTML when used with javascript it is termed as JSX which is short for
        Java Script XML(Extensible Markup Language). For HTML we can't render
        multiple tags at once, so we use div tag which can contain multiple
        tags. To render we use ReactDOM which is used to link the backend to the
        frontend of any website.
